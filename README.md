# Style guides repository

Repository for general style guides I've written and I've used successfully in different projects in the past. They range from frameworks to languages and everything in between. Everything that has required any "style" to it. They have been ofter further enforced with different linting tools and other tooling practices. I might add those here later too.

Written by me:

* [Angular.js](./angular/README.md)

Not written by me but I draw inspiration from or use directly:
